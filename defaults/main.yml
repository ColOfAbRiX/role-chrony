# Time sources
#

##
# The server directive specifies an NTP server which can be used as a time
# source. The client-server relationship is strictly hierarchical: a client
# might synchronise its system time to that of the server, but the server’s
# system time will never be influenced by that of a client. The server directive
# is immediately followed by either the name of the server, or its IP address.
chrony_conf_servers: []

 #- hostname: pool.ntp.org
   ##
   # Although chronyd will trim the rate at which it samples the server during
   # normal operation, the user might want to constrain the minimum polling
   # interval. This is always defined as a power of 2, so minpoll 5 would mean that
   # the polling interval cannot drop below 32 seconds. The default is 6 (64
   # seconds).
   #minpoll: 6

   ##
   # In a similar way, the user might want to constrain the maximum polling interval.
   # Again this is specified as a power of 2, maxpoll 9 indicates that the polling
   # interval must stay at or below 512 seconds. The default is 10 (1024 seconds).
   #maxpoll: 10

   # If this option is set, the interval between the first four polls will be 2
   # seconds instead of minpoll. This is useful to quickly get the first update of
   # the clock after chronyd is started.
   #iburst: yes

   ##
   # The NTP protocol supports the inclusion of checksums in the packets, to
   # prevent computers having their system time upset by rogue packets being sent
   # to them. The checksums are generated as a function of a password, using the
   # cryptographic hash function set in the key file, which is specified by the
   # keyfile directive. If the key option is present, chronyd will attempt to use
   # authenticated packets when communicating with this server. The key number used
   # will be the single argument to the key option (an unsigned integer in the
   # range 1 through 2^32-1). The server must have the same password for this key
   # number configured, otherwise no relationship between the computers will be
   # possible.
   #key: id

   ##
   # chronyd uses the network round-trip delay to the server to determine how
   # accurate a particular measurement is likely to be. Long round-trip delays
   # indicate that the request, or the response, or both were delayed. If only one
   # of the messages was delayed the measurement error is likely to be substantial.
   # For small variations in the round-trip delay, chronyd uses a weighting scheme
   # when processing the measurements. However, beyond a certain level of delay the
   # measurements are likely to be so corrupted as to be useless. (This is
   # particularly so on dial-up or other slow links, where a long delay probably
   # indicates a highly asymmetric delay caused by the response waiting behind a
   # lot of packets related to a download of some sort). If the user knows that
   # round trip delays above a certain level should cause the measurement to be
   # ignored, this level can be defined with the maxdelay option. For example,
   # maxdelay 0.3 would indicate that measurements with a round-trip delay of 0.3
   # seconds or more should be ignored. The default value is 3 seconds.
   #maxdelay: 3

   ##
   # This option is similar to the maxdelay option above. chronyd keeps a record of
   # the minimum round-trip delay amongst the previous measurements that it has
   # buffered. If a measurement has a round trip delay that is greater than the
   # maxdelayratio times the minimum delay, it will be rejected.
   #maxdelayratio: ratio

   ##
   # If a measurement has a ratio of the increase in the round-trip delay from the
   # minimum delay amongst the previous measurements to the standard deviation of
   # the previous measurements that is greater than the specified ratio, it will be
   # rejected. The default is 10.0.
   #maxdelaydevratio: 10.0

   ##
   # Set the minimum number of samples kept for this source. This overrides the
   # minsamples directive.
   #minsamples: samples

   # Set the maximum number of samples kept for this source. This overrides the
   # maxsamples directive.

   ##
   # If the server will not be reachable when chronyd is started, the offline
   # option can be specified. chronyd will not try to poll the server until it is
   # enabled to do so (by using the online command in chronyc).
   #offline: false

   ##
   # If this option is set, the server will be assumed to have gone offline when 2
   # requests have been sent to it without receiving a response. This option avoids
   # the need to run the offline command from chronyc when disconnecting the
   # network link. (It will still be necessary to use the online command when the
   # link has been established, to enable measurements to start.)

   # Never select this source. This is particularly useful for monitoring.
   #noselect: no

   ##
   # Assume time from this source is always true. It can be rejected as a
   # falseticker in the source selection only if another source with this option
   # does not agree with it.
   #trust: no

   ##
   # Require that at least one of the sources specified with this option is
   # selectable (i.e. recently reachable and not a falseticker) before updating the
   # clock. Together with the trust option this might be useful to allow a trusted
   # authenticated source to be safely combined with unauthenticated sources in
   # order to improve the accuracy of the clock. They can be selected and used for
   # synchronisation only if they agree with the trusted and required source.
   #require: no

   ##
   # Target number of measurements to use for the regression algorithm which
   # chronyd will try to maintain by adjusting the polling interval between minpoll
   # and maxpoll. A higher target makes chronyd prefer shorter polling intervals.
   # The default is 6 and a useful range is from 6 to 60.
   #polltarget: 6

   ##
   # This option allows the UDP port on which the server understands NTP requests
   # to be specified. For normal servers this option should not be required (the
   # default is 123, the standard NTP port).
   #port: 123

   ##
   # If the timing measurements being made by chronyd are the only network data
   # passing between two computers, you might find that some measurements are badly
   # skewed due to either the client or the server having to do an ARP lookup on
   # the other party prior to transmitting a packet. This is more of a problem with
   # long sampling intervals, which might be similar in duration to the lifetime of
   # entries in the ARP caches of the machines. In order to avoid this problem, the
   # presend option can be used. It takes a single integer argument, which is the
   # smallest polling interval for which an extra pair of NTP packets will be
   # exchanged between the client and the server prior to the actual measurement.
   # For example, with the following option included in a server directive: presend
   # 9 when the polling interval is 512 seconds or more, an extra NTP client packet
   # will be sent to the server a short time (4 seconds) before making the actual
   # measurement.
   #presend: poll

   ##
   # When the synchronisation source is selected from available sources, sources
   # with lower stratum are normally slightly preferred. This option can be used to
   # increase stratum of the source to the specified minimum, so chronyd will avoid
   # selecting that source. This is useful with low stratum sources that are known
   # to be unreliable or inaccurate and which should be used only when other
   # sources are unreachable.
   #minstratum: stratum

   ##
   # This option sets the NTP version number used in packets sent to the server.
   # This can be useful when the server runs an old NTP implementation that does
   # not respond to newer versions. The default version number is 4.
   #version: 4

##
# The syntax of this directive is similar to that for the server directive,
# except that it is used to specify a pool of NTP servers rather than a single
# NTP server. The pool name is expected to resolve to multiple addresses which
# might change over time. All options valid in the server directive can be used
# in this directive too. There is one option specific to the pool directive:
# maxsources sets the maximum number of sources that can be used from the pool,
# the default value is 4. On start, when the pool name is resolved, chronyd will
# add up to 16 sources, one for each resolved address. When the number of
# sources from which at least one valid reply was received reaches the number
# specified by the maxsources option, the other sources will be removed. When a
# pool source is unreachable, marked as a falseticker, or has a distance larger
# than the limit set by the maxdistance directive, chronyd will try to replace
# the source with a newly resolved address from the pool.
chrony_conf_pools: []

##
# The syntax of this directive is identical to that for the server directive,
# except that it is used to specify an NTP peer rather than an NTP server.  When
# a key is specified by the key option to enable authentication, both peers must
# be configured to use the same key and the same key number.  Please note that
# NTP peers that are not configured with a key to enable authentication are
# vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A
# and B are peering with each other can send a packet with random timestamps to
# host A with source address of B which will set the NTP state variables on A to
# the values sent by the attacker. Host A will then send on its next poll to B a
# packet with an origin timestamp that does not match the transmit timestamp of
# B and the packet will be dropped. If the attacker does this periodically for
# both hosts, they will not be able to synchronise to each other.  This attack
# can be prevented by enabling authentication with the key option, or by using
# the server directive on both sides to specify the other host as a server
# instead of a peer. The disadvantage of the server directive is that it will
# double the network traffic between the two hosts.
chrony_conf_peers: []

##
# In normal operation, chronyd slews the time when it needs to adjust the system
# clock. For example, to correct a system clock which is 1 second slow, chronyd
# slightly increases the amount by which the system clock is advanced on each
# clock interrupt, until the error is removed. Note that at no time does time
# run backwards with this method.  On most Unix systems it is not desirable to
# step the system clock, because many programs rely on time advancing
# monotonically forwards.  When the chronyd daemon is initially started, it is
# possible that the system clock is considerably in error. Attempting to correct
# such an error by slewing might not be sensible, since it might take several
# hours to correct the error by this means.  The purpose of the initstepslew
# directive is to allow chronyd to make a rapid measurement of the system clock
# error at boot time, and to correct the system clock by stepping before normal
# operation begins. Since this would normally be performed only at an
# appropriate point in the system boot sequence, no other software should be
# adversely affected by the step.  If the correction required is less than a
# specified threshold, a slew is used instead. This makes it safer to restart
# chronyd whilst the system is in normal operation.  The initstepslew directive
# takes a threshold and a list of NTP servers as arguments. Each of the servers
# is rapidly polled several times, and a majority voting mechanism used to find
# the most likely range of system clock error that is present. A step or slew is
# applied to the system clock to correct this error. chronyd then enters its
# normal operating mode.

# The refclock directive specifies a hardware reference clock to be used as a
# time source. It has two mandatory parameters, a driver name and a driver-
# specific parameter.
chrony_conf_refclocks: []
   ##
   # Drivers/Parameters:
   #   PPS
   #     Driver for the kernel PPS (pulse per second) API. The parameter is the path to
   #     the PPS device (typically /dev/pps?). The assert events are used for
   #     synchronisation by default. String :clear can be appended to the path to use the
   #     clear events instead. As PPS refclocks don’t supply full time, chronyd needs to
   #     be configured with another time source (NTP or non-PPS refclock) in order to
   #     complete samples from the PPS refclock. An alternative is to enable the local
   #     directive to allow synchronisation with some unknown but constant offset. For
   #     example: refclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refclock SHM 0 offset 0.5 delay 0.2
   #     refid NMEA noselect
   #   SHM
   #     NTP shared memory driver. This driver uses a shared memory segment to receive
   #     samples from another process. The parameter is the number of the shared memory
   #     segment, typically 0, 1, 2 or 3. For example: refclock SHM 1 poll 3 refid GPS1 A
   #     driver option in form of :perm=NNN can be appended to the segment number to
   #     create the segment with permissions other than the default 0600. Examples of
   #     applications that can be used as SHM refclocks are gpsd, radioclk, and omnisync.
   #   SOCK
   #     Unix domain socket driver. It is similar to the SHM driver, but samples are
   #     received from a Unix domain socket instead of shared memory and the messages
   #     have a different format. The parameter is the path to the socket, which chronyd
   #     creates on start. An advantage over the SHM driver is that SOCK does not require
   #     polling and it can receive PPS samples with incomplete time. The format of the
   #     messages is described in the refclock_sock.c file in the chrony source code. An
   #     application which supports the SOCK protocol is the gpsd daemon. The path where
   #     gpsd expects the socket to be created is described in the gpsd(8) man page. For
   #     example: refclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock
   #   PHC
   #     PTP hardware clock (PHC) driver. The parameter is the path to the device of the
   #     PTP clock, which for example can be synchronised by ptp4l from linuxptp. PTP
   #     clocks are typically kept in TAI instead of UTC, so the offset option should be
   #     used to compensate for the current UTC-TAI offset. For example: refclock PHC
   #     /dev/ptp0 poll 3 dpoll -2 offset -36
   #
   # Options:
   #   poll poll
   #     Timestamps produced by refclock drivers are not used immediately, but they are
   #     stored and processed by a median filter in the polling interval specified by
   #     this option. This is defined as a power of 2 and can be negative to specify a
   #     sub-second interval. The default is 4 (16 seconds). A shorter interval allows
   #     chronyd to react faster to changes in the frequency of the system clock, but it
   #     might have a negative effect on its accuracy if the samples have a lot of
   #     jitter.
   #   dpoll dpoll
   #     Some drivers do not listen for external events and try to produce samples in
   #     their own polling interval. This is defined as a power of 2 and can be negative
   #     to specify a sub-second interval. The default is 0 (1 second).
   #   refid refid
   #     This option is used to specify the reference ID of the refclock, as up to four
   #     ASCII characters. The default reference ID is composed from the first three
   #     characters of the driver name and the number of the refclock. Each refclock must
   #     have a unique reference ID.
   #   lock refid
   #     This option can be used to lock a PPS refclock to another refclock, which is
   #     specified by its reference ID. In this mode received PPS samples are paired
   #     directly with raw samples from the specified refclock.
   #   rate rate
   #     This option sets the rate of the pulses in the PPS signal (in Hz). This option
   #     controls how the pulses will be completed with real time. To actually receive
   #     more than one pulse per second, a negative dpoll has to be specified (-3 for a
   #     5Hz signal). The default is 1.
   #   offset offset
   #     This option can be used to compensate for a constant error. The specified offset
   #     (in seconds) is applied to all samples produced by the reference clock. The
   #     default is 0.0.
   #   delay delay
   #     This option sets the NTP delay of the source (in seconds). Half of this value is
   #     included in the maximum assumed error which is used in the source selection
   #     algorithm. Increasing the delay is useful to avoid having no majority in the
   #     source selection or to make it prefer other sources. The default is 1e-9 (1
   #     nanosecond).
   #   precision precision
   #     This option sets the refclock precision (in seconds). The default is 1e-6 (1
   #     microsecond) for SHM refclock, and 1e-9 (1 nanosecond) for SOCK, PPS and PHC
   #     refclocks.
   #   maxdispersion dispersion
   #     Maximum allowed dispersion for filtered samples (in seconds). Samples with
   #     larger estimated dispersion are ignored. By default, this limit is disabled.
   #   filter samples
   #     This option sets the length of the median filter which is used to reduce the
   #     noise in the measurements. With each poll about 40 percent of the stored samples
   #     are discarded and one final sample is calculated as an average of the remaining
   #     samples. If the length is 4 or more, at least 4 samples have to be collected
   #     between polls. For lengths below 4, the filter has to be full. The default is
   #     64.
   #   prefer
   #     Prefer this source over sources without the prefer option.
   #   noselect
   #     Never select this source. This is useful for monitoring or with sources which
   #     are not very accurate, but are locked with a PPS refclock.
   #   trust
   #     Assume time from this source is always true. It can be rejected as a falseticker
   #     in the source selection only if another source with this option does not agree
   #     with it.
   #   require
   #     Require that at least one of the sources specified with this option is
   #     selectable (i.e. recently reachable and not a falseticker) before updating the
   #     clock. Together with the trust option this can be useful to allow a trusted, but
   #     not very precise, reference clock to be safely combined with unauthenticated NTP
   #     sources in order to improve the accuracy of the clock. They can be selected and
   #     used for synchronisation only if they agree with the trusted and required
   #     source.
   #   minsamples samples
   #     Set the minimum number of samples kept for this source. This overrides the

# By default, chronyd uses a separate client socket for each configured server and

# can be useful for getting through some firewalls. If set to 0, the source port
# of the socket will be chosen arbitrarily.
# It can be set to the same port as is used by the NTP server (which can be

#chrony_conf_acquisitionport: 1123

##
# The bindacqaddress directive sets the network interface to which chronyd will

#chrony_conf_bindacqaddress: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4['interface'] }}"

##
# To compute the rate of gain or loss of time, chronyd has to store a
# measurement history for each of the time sources it uses. Certain systems
# (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris) have operating system support for setting
# the rate of gain or loss to compensate for known errors. (On Mac OS X, chronyd
# must simulate such a capability by periodically slewing the system clock
# forwards or backwards by a suitable amount to compensate for the error built
# up since the previous slew.) For such systems, it is possible to save the
# measurement history across restarts of chronyd (assuming no changes are made
# to the system clock behaviour whilst it is not running). If this capability is
# to be used (via the dumponexit directive in the configuration file, or the
# dump command in chronyc), the dumpdir directive should be used to define the
# directory where the measurement histories are saved.
#chrony_conf_dumpdir: directory

# If this directive is present, it indicates that chronyd should save the
# measurement history for each of its time sources recorded whenever the program
# exits. (See the dumpdir directive above.)

##
# The maxsamples directive sets the default maximum number of samples that

#chrony_conf_maxsamples: 0

#chrony_conf_minsamples: 0


#
# Source selection
#

##
# When chronyd has multiple sources available for synchronisation, it has to
# select one source as the synchronisation source. The measured offsets and
# frequencies of the system clock relative to the other sources, however, can be
# combined with the selected source to improve the accuracy of the system clock.
# The combinelimit directive limits which sources are included in the combining
# algorithm. Their synchronisation distance has to be shorter than the distance
# of the selected source multiplied by the value of the limit. Also, their
# measured frequencies have to be close to the frequency of the selected source.
# By default, the limit is 3. Setting the limit to 0 effectively disables the
# source combining algorithm and only the selected source will be used to
# control the system clock.
#chrony_conf_combinelimit: 3

##
# The maxdistance directive sets the maximum allowed root distance of the
# sources to not be rejected by the source selection algorithm. The distance
# includes the accumulated dispersion, which might be large when the source is
# no longer synchronised, and half of the total round-trip delay to the primary
# source. By default, the maximum root distance is 3 seconds. Setting
# maxdistance to a larger value can be useful to allow synchronisation with a
# server that only has a very infrequent connection to its sources and can
# accumulate a large dispersion between updates of its clock.
#chrony_conf_maxdistance: 3

##
# The minsources directive sets the minimum number of sources that need to be
# considered as selectable in the source selection algorithm before the local
# clock is updated. The default value is 1. Setting this option to a larger
# number can be used to improve the reliability. More sources will have to agree
# with each other and the clock will not be updated when only one source (which
# could be serving incorrect time) is reachable.
#chrony_conf_minsources: 1

# When chronyd selects a synchronisation source from available sources, it will
# prefer the one with the shortest synchronisation distance. However, to avoid
# frequent reselecting when there are sources with similar distance, a fixed
# distance is added to the distance for sources that are currently not selected.
# This can be set with the reselectdist directive. By default, the distance is
# 100 microseconds.
#chrony_conf_reselectdist: 100

##
# The stratumweight directive sets how much distance should be added per stratum
# to the synchronisation distance when chronyd selects the synchronisation
# source from available sources. By default, the weight is 0.001 seconds. This

# when the differences between the distances are in milliseconds.
chrony_conf_stratumweight: 0


#
# System clock
#

##
# When chronyd is slewing the system clock to correct an offset, the rate at
# which it is slewing adds to the frequency error of the clock. On Linux,
# FreeBSD, NetBSD and Solaris this rate can be controlled. The corrtimeratio
# directive sets the ratio between the duration in which the clock is slewed for
# an average correction according to the source history and the interval in
# which the corrections are done (usually the NTP polling interval). Corrections
# larger than the average take less time and smaller corrections take more time,
# the amount of the correction and the correction time are inversely
# proportional. Increasing corrtimeratio improves the overall frequency error of
# the system clock, but increases the overall time error as the corrections take
# longer. By default, the ratio is set to 3, the time accuracy of the clock is
# preferred over its frequency accuracy. The maximum allowed slew rate can be
# set by the maxslewrate directive. The current remaining correction is shown in
# the tracking report as the System time value.
#chrony_conf_corrtimeratio: 3

##
# One of the main activities of the chronyd program is to work out the rate at
# which the system clock gains or loses time relative to real time. Whenever
# chronyd computes a new value of the gain or loss rate, it is desirable to
# record it somewhere. This allows chronyd to begin compensating the system
# clock at that rate whenever it is restarted, even before it has had a chance
# to obtain an equally good estimate of the rate during the new run. (This
# process can take many minutes, at least.) The driftfile directive allows a
# file to be specified into which chronyd can store the rate information. Two
# parameters are recorded in the file. The first is the rate at which the system
# clock gains or loses time, expressed in parts per million, with gains
# positive. Therefore, a value of 100.0 indicates that when the system clock has
# advanced by a second, it has gained 100 microseconds in reality (so the true
# time has only advanced by 999900 microseconds). The second is an estimate of
# the error bound around the first value in which the true rate actually lies.
# An example of the driftfile directive is: driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
chrony_conf_driftfile: /var/lib/chrony/drift

##
# Fallback drifts are long-term averages of the system clock drift calculated
# over exponentially increasing intervals. They are used when the clock is no
# longer synchronised to avoid quickly drifting away from true time if there was
# a short-term deviation in the drift before the synchronisation was lost. The
# directive specifies the minimum and maximum interval since the last clock
# update to switch between fallback drifts. They are defined as a power of 2 (in
# seconds). The syntax is as follows: fallbackdrift 16 19 In this example, the
# minimum interval is 16 (18 hours) and the maximum interval is 19 (6 days). The
# system clock frequency will be set to the first fallback 18 hours after last
# clock update, to the second after 36 hours, etc. This might be a good setting
# to cover daily and weekly temperature fluctuations. By default (or if the
# specified maximum or minimum is 0), no fallbacks are used and the clock
# frequency changes only with new measurements from NTP sources, reference
# clocks, or manual input.

# A leap second is an adjustment that is occasionally applied to UTC to keep it

# January 1970 without leap seconds. The system clock cannot have time 23:59:60,
# every minute has 60 seconds and every day has 86400 seconds by definition. The
# inserted leap second is skipped and the clock is suddenly ahead of UTC by one
# second. The leapsecmode directive selects how that error is corrected. There
# are four options:
# system
#     When inserting a leap second, the kernel steps the system clock backwards
#     by one second when the clock gets to 00:00:00 UTC. When deleting a leap
#     second, it steps forward by one second when the clock gets to 23:59:59
#     UTC. This is the default mode when the system driver supports leap seconds
#     (i.e. on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Solaris).
# step
#     This is similar to the system mode, except the clock is stepped by chronyd
#     instead of the kernel. It can be useful to avoid bugs in the kernel code
#     that would be executed in the system mode. This is the default mode when
#     the system driver does not support leap seconds.
# slew
#     The clock is corrected by slewing started at 00:00:00 UTC when a leap
#     second is inserted or 23:59:59 UTC when a leap second is deleted. This
#     might be preferred over the system and step modes when applications
#     running on the system are sensitive to jumps in the system time and it is
#     acceptable that the clock will be off for a longer time. On Linux with the
#     default maxslewrate value the correction takes 12 seconds.
# ignore
#     No correction is applied to the clock for the leap second. The clock will
#     be corrected later in normal operation when new measurements are made and
#     the estimated offset includes the one second error.
# When serving time to NTP clients that cannot be configured to correct their
# clocks for a leap second by slewing, or to clients that would correct at
# slightly different rates when it is necessary to keep them close together, the
# slew mode can be combined with the smoothtime directive to enable a server
# leap smear. When smearing a leap second, the leap status is suppressed on the
# server and the served time is corrected slowly be slewing instead of stepping.
# The clients do not need any special configuration as they do not know there is
# any leap second and they follow the server time which eventually brings them
# back to UTC. Care must be taken to ensure they use only NTP servers which
# smear the leap second in exactly the same way for synchronisation. This
# feature must be used carefully, because the server is intentionally not
# serving its best estimate of the true time.
#chrony_conf_leapsecmode: system

##
# This directive is used to set the name of the timezone in the system tz
# database which chronyd can use to find out when will the next leap second
# occur. It will periodically check if the times 23:59:59 and 23:59:60 are valid
# on Jun 30 and Dec 31 in the timezone. This typically works with the right/UTC
# timezone. This directive is mainly useful with reference clocks which do not
# provide leap second information. It is not necessary to restart chronyd if the
# tz database is updated with a new leap second at least 12 hours before the
# event.
#chrony_conf_leapsectz: timezone

##
# Normally chronyd will cause the system to gradually correct any time offset,
# by slowing down or speeding up the clock as required. In certain situations,
# the system clock might be so far adrift that this slewing process would take a
# very long time to correct the system clock. This directive forces chronyd to
# step the system clock if the adjustment is larger than a threshold value, but
# only if there were no more clock updates since chronyd was started than a
# specified limit (a negative value can be used to disable the limit). This is
# particularly useful when using reference clocks, because the initstepslew
# directive works only with NTP sources.
chrony_conf_makestep: [10, 3]

##
# This directive sets the maximum allowed offset corrected on a clock update.
# The check is performed only after the specified number of updates to allow a
# large initial adjustment of the system clock. When an offset larger than the
# specified maximum occurs, it will be ignored for the specified number of times
# and then chronyd will give up and exit (a negative value can be used to never
# exit). In both cases a message is sent to syslog.
#chrony_conf_maxchange: [offset, start, ignore]

##
# The maxclockerror directive sets the maximum assumed frequency error that the
# system clock can gain on its own between clock updates. It describes the
# stability of the clock. By default, the maximum error is 1 ppm. Typical values
# for error-in-ppm might be 10 for a low quality clock and 0.1 for a high
# quality clock using a temperature compensated crystal oscillator.
#chrony_conf_maxclockerror: 1

##
# This directive specifies the maximum assumed drift (frequency error) of the
# system clock. It limits the frequency adjustment that chronyd is allowed to
# use to correct the measured drift. It is an additional limit to the maximum
# adjustment that can be set by the system driver (100000 ppm on Linux, 500 ppm
# on FreeBSD and NetBSD, 32500 ppm on Solaris). By default, the maximum assumed
# drift is 500000 ppm, i.e. the adjustment is limited by the system driver
# rather than this directive.
#chrony_conf_maxdrift: 500000

##
# One of chronyd's tasks is to work out how fast or slow the computer’s clock
# runs relative to its reference sources. In addition, it computes an estimate
# of the error bounds around the estimated value. If the range of error is too
# large, it probably indicates that the measurements have not settled down yet,
# and that the estimated gain or loss rate is not very reliable. The
# maxupdateskew directive sets the threshold for determining whether an estimate
# might be so unreliable that it should not be used. By default, the threshold
# is 1000 ppm. Typical values for skew-in-ppm might be 100 for a dial-up
# connection to servers over a phone line, and 5 or 10 for a computer on a LAN.
# It should be noted that this is not the only means of protection against using
# unreliable estimates. At all times, chronyd keeps track of both the estimated
# gain or loss rate, and the error bound on the estimate. When a new estimate is
# generated following another measurement from one of the sources, a weighted
# combination algorithm is used to update the master estimate. So if chronyd has
# an existing highly-reliable master estimate and a new estimate is generated
# which has large error bounds, the existing master estimate will dominate in
# the new master estimate.
#chrony_conf_maxupdateskew: 1000

##
# The maxslewrate directive sets the maximum rate at which chronyd is allowed to
# slew the time. It limits the slew rate controlled by the correction time ratio
# (which can be set by the corrtimeratio directive) and is effective only on
# systems where chronyd is able to control the rate (i.e. Linux, FreeBSD,
# NetBSD, Solaris). For each system there is a maximum frequency offset of the
# clock that can be set by the driver. On Linux it is 100000 ppm, on FreeBSD and
# NetBSD it is 5000 ppm, and on Solaris it is 32500 ppm. Also, due to a kernel
# limitation, setting maxslewrate on FreeBSD and NetBSD to a value between 500
# ppm and 5000 ppm will effectively set it to 500 ppm. By default, the maximum
# slew rate is set to 83333.333 ppm (one twelfth).
#chrony_conf_maxslewrate: 83333.333

##
# Normally, changes in the rate of drift of the system clock are caused mainly
# by changes in the temperature of the crystal oscillator on the motherboard. If
# there are temperature measurements available from a sensor close to the
# oscillator, the tempcomp directive can be used to compensate for the changes
# in the temperature and improve the stability and accuracy of the clock. The
# result depends on many factors, including the resolution of the sensor, the
# amount of noise in the measurements, the polling interval of the time source,
# the compensation update interval, how well the compensation is specified, and
# how close the sensor is to the oscillator. When it is working well, the
# frequency reported in the tracking.log file is more stable and the maximum
# reached offset is smaller. There are two forms of the directive. The first one
# has six parameters: a path to the file containing the current temperature from
# the sensor (in text format), the compensation update interval (in seconds),
# and temperature coefficients T0, k0, k1, k2. The frequency compensation is
# calculated (in ppm) as:
# k0 + (T - T0) * k1 + (T - T0)^2 * k2
# The result has to be between -10 ppm and 10 ppm, otherwise the measurement is
# considered invalid and will be ignored. The k0 coefficient can be adjusted to
# keep the compensation in that range.
#chrony_conf_tempcomp: [file, interval, T0, k0, k1, k2]

#
# NTP server
#

##
# The allow directive is used to designate a particular subnet from which NTP
# clients are allowed to access the computer as an NTP server. The default is
# that no clients are allowed access, i.e. chronyd operates purely as an NTP
# client. If the allow directive is used, chronyd will be both a client of its
# servers, and a server to other clients.
# Examples of the use of the directive are as follows:
# allow foo.example.net
# allow 1.2
# allow 3.4.5
# allow 6.7.8/22
# allow 6.7.8.9/22
# allow 2001:db8::/32
# allow 0/0
# allow ::/0
# allow
# The first directive allows the named node to be an NTP client of this
# computer. The second directive allows any node with an IPv4 address of the
# form 1.2.x.y (with x and y arbitrary) to be an NTP client of this computer.
# Likewise, the third directive allows any node with an IPv4 address of the form
# 3.4.5.x to have client NTP access. The fourth and fifth forms allow access
# from any node with an IPv4 address of the form 6.7.8.x, 6.7.9.x, 6.7.10.x or
# 6.7.11.x (with x arbitrary), i.e. the value 22 is the number of bits defining
# the specified subnet. In the fifth form, the final byte is ignored. The sixth
# form is used for IPv6 addresses. The seventh and eighth forms allow access by
# any IPv4 and IPv6 node respectively. The ninth forms allows access by any node
# (IPv4 or IPv6). A second form of the directive, allow all, has a greater
# effect, depending on the ordering of directives in the configuration file. To
# illustrate the effect, consider the two examples:
# allow 1.2.3.4
# deny 1.2.3
# allow 1.2
# and
# allow 1.2.3.4
# deny 1.2.3
# allow all 1.2
# In the first example, the effect is the same regardless of what order the
# three directives are given in. So the 1.2.x.y subnet is allowed access, except
# for the 1.2.3.x subnet, which is denied access, however the host 1.2.3.4 is
# allowed access. In the second example, the allow all 1.2 directives overrides
# the effect of any previous directive relating to a subnet within the specified
# subnet. Within a configuration file this capability is probably rather moot;
# however, it is of greater use for reconfiguration at run-time via chronyc with
# the allow all command. Note, if the initstepslew directive is used in the
# configuration file, each of the computers listed in that directive must allow
# client access by this computer for it to work.
chrony_conf_allows: []

##
# This is similar to the allow directive, except that it denies NTP client
# access to a particular subnet or host, rather than allowing it. The syntax is
# identical. There is also a deny all directive with similar behaviour to the
# allow all directive.
chrony_conf_denies: []

##
# The bindaddress directive allows you to restrict the network interface to
# which chronyd will listen for NTP requests. This provides an additional level
# of access restriction above that available through the deny mechanism. Suppose
# you have a local network with addresses in the 192.168.1.0 subnet together
# with an Internet connection. The network interface’s IP address is
# 192.168.1.1. Suppose you want to block all access through the Internet
# connection. You could add the line: bindaddress 192.168.1.1 to the
# configuration file. For each of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, only one
# bindaddress directive can be specified. Therefore, it is not useful on
# computers which should serve NTP on multiple network interfaces.
#chrony_conf_bindaddress: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4['interface'] }}"

##
# The broadcast directive is used to declare a broadcast address to which
# chronyd should send packets in the NTP broadcast mode (i.e. make chronyd act
# as a broadcast server). Broadcast clients on that subnet will be able to
# synchronise.
# The syntax is as follows:
# broadcast 30 192.168.1.255
# broadcast 60 192.168.2.255 12123
# broadcast 60 ff02::101
# In the first example, the destination port defaults to UDP port 123 (the
# normal NTP port). In the second example, the destination port is specified as
# 12123. The first parameter in each case (30 or 60 respectively) is the
# interval in seconds between broadcast packets being sent. The second parameter
# in each case is the broadcast address to send the packet to. This should
# correspond to the broadcast address of one of the network interfaces on the
# computer where chronyd is running. You can have more than 1 broadcast
# directive if you have more than 1 network interface onto which you want to
# send NTP broadcast packets. chronyd itself cannot act as a broadcast client;
# it must always be configured as a point-to-point client by defining specific
# NTP servers and peers. This broadcast server feature is intended for providing
# a time source to other NTP implementations. If ntpd is used as the broadcast
# client, it will try to measure the round-trip delay between the server and
# client with normal client mode packets. Thus, the broadcast subnet should also
# be the subject of an allow directive.
chrony_conf_broadcast: []

##
# This directive specifies the maximum amount of memory that chronyd is allowed
# to allocate for logging of client accesses. The default limit is 524288 bytes,
# which allows monitoring of several thousands of addresses at the same time. In
# older chrony versions if the limit was set to 0, the memory allocation was
# unlimited.
# An example of the use of this directive is:
# clientloglimit 1048576
#chrony_conf_clientloglimit: 524288

##
# This directive, which takes no arguments, specifies that client accesses are
# not to be logged. Normally they are logged, allowing statistics to be reported
# using the clients command in chronyc.
chrony_conf_noclientlog: true

##
# The local directive enables a local reference mode, which allows chronyd
# operating as an NTP server to appear synchronised to real time (from the
# viewpoint of clients polling it), even when it was never synchronised or the
# last update of the clock happened a long time ago. This directive is normally
# used in an isolated network, where computers are required to be synchronised
# to one another, but not necessarily to real time. The server can be kept
# vaguely in line with real time by manual input.
# The local directive has the following options:
# stratum stratum
#     This option sets the stratum of the server which will be reported to
#     clients when the local reference is active. The specified value is in the
#     range 1 through 15, and the default value is 10. It should be larger than
#     the maximum expected stratum in the network when external NTP servers are
#     accessible. Stratum 1 indicates a computer that has a true real-time
#     reference directly connected to it (e.g. GPS, atomic clock, etc.), such
#     computers are expected to be very close to real time. Stratum 2 computers
#     are those which have a stratum 1 server; stratum 3 computers have a
#     stratum 2 server and so on. A value of 10 indicates that the clock is so
#     many hops away from a reference clock that its time is fairly unreliable.
# distance distance
#     This option sets the threshold for the root distance which will activate
#     the local reference. If chronyd was synchronised to some source, the local
#     reference will not be activated until its root distance reaches the
#     specified value (the rate at which the distance is increasing depends on
#     how well the clock was tracking the source). The default value is 1
#     second. The current root distance can be calculated from root delay and
#     root dispersion (reported by the tracking command in chronyc) as: distance
#     = delay / 2 + dispersion
# orphan
#     This option enables a special ‘orphan’ mode, where sources with stratum
#     equal to the local stratum are assumed to not serve real time. They are
#     ignored unless no other source is selectable and their reference IDs are
#     smaller than the local reference ID. This allows multiple servers in the
#     network to use the same local configuration and to be synchronised to one
#     another, without confusing clients that poll more than one server. Each
#     server needs to be configured to poll all other servers with the local
#     directive. This ensures only the server with the smallest reference ID has
#     the local reference active and others are synchronised to it. When that
#     server fails, another will take over. The orphan mode is compatible with
#     the ntpd's orphan mode (enabled by the tos orphan command).
#chrony_conf_local:
#  stratum: 1
#  distance: 3
#  orphan: false

##
# This option allows you to configure the port on which chronyd will listen for
# NTP requests. The port will be open only when an address is allowed by the
# allow directive or the allow command in chronyc, an NTP peer is configured, or
# the broadcast server mode is enabled. The default value is 123, the standard
# NTP port. If set to 0, chronyd will never open the server port and will
# operate strictly in a client-only mode. The source port used in NTP client
# requests can be set by the acquisitionport directive.
#chrony_conf_port: 123

##
# This directive enables response rate limiting for NTP packets. Its purpose is
# to reduce network traffic with misconfigured or broken NTP clients that are
# polling the server too frequently. The limits are applied to individual IP
# addresses. If multiple clients share one IP address (e.g. multiple hosts
# behind NAT), the sum of their traffic will be limited. If a client that
# increases its polling rate when it does not receive a reply is detected, its
# rate limiting will be temporarily suspended to avoid increasing the overall
# amount of traffic. The maximum number of IP addresses which can be monitored
# at the same time depends on the memory limit set by the clientloglimit
# directive. The ratelimit directive supports a number of options (which can be
# defined in any order):
# interval
#     This option sets the minimum interval between responses. It is defined as
#     a power of 2 in seconds. The default value is 3 (8 seconds). The minimum
#     value is -4 and the maximum value is 12.
# burst
#     This option sets the maximum number of responses that can be sent in a
#     burst, temporarily exceeding the limit specified by the interval option.
#     This is useful for clients that make rapid measurements on start (e.g.
#     chronyd with the iburst option). The default value is 8. The minimum value
#     is 1 and the maximum value is 255.
# leak
#     This option sets the rate at which responses are randomly allowed even if
#     the limits specified by the interval and burst options are exceeded. This
#     is necessary to prevent an attacker who is sending requests with a spoofed
#     source address from completely blocking responses to that address. The
#     leak rate is defined as a power of 1/2 and it is 3 by default, i.e. on
#     average at least every eighth request has a response. The minimum value is
#     1 and the maximum value is 4.
# An example use of the directive is:
# ratelimit interval 4 burst 4
# This would reduce the response rate for IP addresses that send packets on
# average more frequently than once per 16 seconds or send packets in bursts of
# more than 4 packets.
#chrony_conf_ratelimit:
#  interval: 3
#  burst: 8
#  leak: false

##
# The smoothtime directive can be used to enable smoothing of the time that
# chronyd serves to its clients to make it easier for them to track it and keep
# their clocks close together even when large offset or frequency corrections
# are applied to the server’s clock, for example after being offline for a
# longer time. BE WARNED: The server is intentionally not serving its best
# estimate of the true time. If a large offset has been accumulated, it can take
# a very long time to smooth it out. This directive should be used only when the
# clients are not configured to also poll another NTP server, because they could
# reject this server as a falseticker or fail to select a source completely. The
# smoothing process is implemented with a quadratic spline function with two or
# three pieces. It is independent from any slewing applied to the local system
# clock, but the accumulated offset and frequency will be reset when the clock
# is corrected by stepping, e.g. by the makestep directive or the makestep
# command in chronyc. The process can be reset without stepping the clock by the
# smoothtime reset command. The first two arguments of the directive are the
# maximum frequency offset of the smoothed time to the tracked NTP time (in ppm)
# and the maximum rate at which the frequency offset is allowed to change (in
# ppm per second). leaponly is an optional third argument which enables a mode
# where only leap seconds are smoothed out and normal offset and frequency
# changes are ignored. The leaponly option is useful in a combination with the
# leapsecmode slew directive to allow the clients to use multiple time smoothing
# servers safely. The smoothing process is activated automatically when 1/10000
# of the estimated skew of the local clock falls below the maximum rate of
# frequency change. It can be also activated manually by the smoothtime activate
# command, which is particularly useful when the clock is synchronised only with
# manual input and the skew is always larger than the threshold. The smoothing
# command can be used to monitor the process.
# An example suitable for clients using ntpd and 1024 second polling interval
# could be:
# smoothtime 400 0.001
# An example suitable for clients using chronyd on Linux could be:
# smoothtime 50000 0.01
#chrony_conf_smoothtime:
#  max_freq: 400
#  max_wander: 0.001
#  leaponly: false


#
# Command: and monitoring access
#

##
# The bindcmdaddress directive allows you to specify the network interface on
# which chronyd will listen for monitoring command packets (issued by chronyc).
# This provides an additional level of access restriction above that available
# through the cmddeny mechanism. This directive can also change the path of the
# Unix domain command socket, which is used by chronyc to send configuration
# commands. The socket must be in a directory that is accessible only by the
# root or chrony user. The directory will be created on start if it does not
# exist. The compiled-in default path of the socket is
# /var/run/chrony/chronyd.sock. By default, chronyd binds to the loopback
# interface (with addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1). This blocks all access except
# from localhost. To listen for command packets on all interfaces, you can add
# the lines:
# bindcmdaddress 0.0.0.0
# bindcmdaddress ::
# to the configuration file.
# For each of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, only one bindcmdaddress directive can
# be specified. An example that sets the path of the Unix domain command socket
# is: bindcmdaddress /var/run/chrony/chronyd.sock
chrony_conf_bindcmdaddress: 127.0.0.1

##
# This is similar to the allow directive, except that it allows monitoring
# access (rather than NTP client access) to a particular subnet or host. (By
# ‘monitoring access’ is meant that chronyc can be run on those hosts and
# retrieve monitoring data from chronyd on this computer.) The syntax is
# identical to the allow directive. There is also a cmdallow all directive with
# similar behaviour to the allow all directive (but applying to monitoring
# access in this case, of course). Note that chronyd has to be configured with
# the bindcmdaddress directive to not listen only on the loopback interface to
# actually allow remote access.
#chrony_conf_cmdallow: [ all ]

##
# This is similar to the cmdallow directive, except that it denies monitoring
# access to a particular subnet or host, rather than allowing it. The syntax is
# identical. There is also a cmddeny all directive with similar behaviour to the
# cmdallow all directive.
#chrony_conf_cmddeny: [all, subnet]

##
# The cmdport directive allows the port that is used for run-time monitoring
# (via the chronyc program) to be altered from its default (323). If set to 0,
# chronyd will not open the port, this is useful to disable chronyc access from
# the Internet. (It does not disable the Unix domain command socket.)
# An example shows the syntax:
# cmdport 257
# This would make chronyd use UDP 257 as its command port. (chronyc would need
# to be run with the -p 257 switch to inter-operate correctly.)
#chrony_conf_cmdport: 323

##
# This directive enables response rate limiting for command packets. It is
# similar to the ratelimit directive, except responses to localhost are never
# limited and the default interval is 1 (2 seconds), the default burst is 16,
# and the default leak rate is 2.
# An example of the use of the directive is:
# cmdratelimit interval 2
#chrony_conf_cmdratelimit:
#  interval: 1
#  burst: 16
#  leak: false


#
# Real-time clock (RTC)
#

##
# The hwclockfile directive sets the location of the adjtime file which is used
# by the hwclock program on Linux. chronyd parses the file to find out if the
# RTC keeps local time or UTC. It overrides the rtconutc directive. The
# compiled-in default value is ''.
# An example of the directive is:
# hwclockfile /etc/adjtime
#chrony_conf_hwclockfile: /etc/adjtime

##
# The rtcautotrim directive is used to keep the RTC close to the system clock
# automatically. When the system clock is synchronised and the estimated error
# between the two clocks is larger than the specified threshold, chronyd will
# trim the RTC as if the trimrtc command in chronyc was issued. This directive
# is effective only with the rtcfile directive.
# An example of the use of this directive is:
# rtcautotrim 30
# This would set the threshold error to 30 seconds.
#chrony_conf_rtcautotrim: 30

##
# The rtcdevice directive sets the path to the device file for accessing the
# RTC. The default path is /dev/rtc.
#chrony_conf_rtcdevice: /dev/rtc

##
# The rtcfile directive defines the name of the file in which chronyd can save
# parameters associated with tracking the accuracy of the RTC.
# An example of the directive is:
# rtcfile /var/lib/chrony/rtc
# chronyd saves information in this file when it exits and when the writertc
# command is issued in chronyc. The information saved is the RTC’s error at some
# epoch, that epoch (in seconds since January 1 1970), and the rate at which the
# RTC gains or loses time.
# So far, the support for real-time clocks is limited; their code is even more
# system-specific than the rest of the software. You can only use the RTC
# facilities (the rtcfile directive and the -s command-line option to chronyd)
# if the following three conditions apply:
#     You are running Linux.
#     The kernel is compiled with extended real-time clock support (i.e. the
#     /dev/rtc device is capable of doing useful things).
#     You do not have other applications that need to make use of /dev/rtc at
#     all.
#chrony_conf_rtcfile: /var/lib/chrony/rtc

##
# chronyd assumes by default that the RTC keeps local time (including any
# daylight saving changes). This is convenient on PCs running Linux which are
# dual-booted with Windows. If you keep the RTC on local time and your computer
# is off when daylight saving (summer time) starts or ends, the computer’s
# system time will be one hour in error when you next boot and start chronyd. An
# alternative is for the RTC to keep Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This does
# not suffer from the 1 hour problem when daylight saving starts or ends. If the
# rtconutc directive appears, it means the RTC is required to keep UTC. The
# directive takes no arguments. It is equivalent to specifying the -u switch to
# the Linux hwclock program. Note that this setting is overridden when the
# hwclockfile directive is specified.
#chrony_conf_rtconutc: false

##
# The rtcsync directive enables a mode where the system time is periodically
# copied to the RTC and chronyd does not try to track its drift. This directive
# cannot be used with the rtcfile directive. On Linux, the RTC copy is performed
# by the kernel every 11 minutes. On Mac OS X, chronyd will perform the RTC copy
# every 60 minutes when the system clock is in a synchronised state. On other

# Logging:
#

##
# The log directive indicates that certain information is to be logged. The log
# files are written to the directory specified by the logdir directive. A banner
# is periodically written to the files to indicate the meanings of the columns.
#   measurements
#     This option logs the raw NTP measurements and related information to a
#     file called measurements.log. An example line (which actually appears as a
#     single line in the file) from the log file is shown below.
#   statistics
#     This option logs information about the regression processing to a file
#     called statistics.log. An example line (which actually appears as a single
#     line in the file) from the log file is shown below.
#   tracking
#     This option logs changes to the estimate of the system’s gain or loss
#     rate, and any slews made, to a file called tracking.log. An example line
#     (which actually appears as a single line in the file) from the log file is
#     shown below.
#   rtc
#     This option logs information about the system’s real-time clock. An
#     example line (which actually appears as a single line in the file) from
#     the rtc.log file is shown below.
#   refclocks
#     This option logs the raw and filtered reference clock measurements to a
#     file called refclocks.log. An example line (which actually appears as a
#     single line in the file) from the log file is shown below.
#   tempcomp
#     This option logs the temperature measurements and system rate
#     compensations to a file called tempcomp.log. An example line (which
#     actually appears as a single line in the file) from the log file is shown
#     below.
# An example of the directive is:
# log measurements statistics tracking
chrony_conf_logs: []

##
# A banner is periodically written to the log files enabled by the log directive
# to indicate the meanings of the columns. The logbanner directive specifies
# after how many entries in the log file should be the banner written. The
# default is 32, and 0 can be used to disable it entirely.
#chrony_conf_logbanner: 32

##
# This directive sets the threshold for the adjustment of the system clock that
# will generate a syslog message. Clock errors detected via NTP packets,
# reference clocks, or timestamps entered via the settime command of chronyc are
# logged. By default, the threshold is 1 second.
# An example of the use is:
# logchange 0.1
# which would cause a syslog message to be generated if a system clock error of
# over 0.1 seconds starts to be compensated.
chrony_conf_logchange: 0.5

##
# This directive allows the directory where log files are written to be
# specified.
# An example of the use of this directive is:
# logdir /var/log/chrony
chrony_conf_logdir: /var/log/chrony

##
# This directive defines an email address to which mail should be sent if
# chronyd applies a correction exceeding a particular threshold to the system
# clock.
# An example of the use of this directive is:
# mailonchange root@localhost 0.5
# This would send a mail message to root if a change of more than 0.5 seconds
# were applied to the system clock. This directive cannot be used when a system
# call filter is enabled by the -F option as the chronyd process will not be
# allowed to fork and execute the sendmail binary.
#chrony_conf_mailonchange: root@localhost 0.5


#
# Miscellaneous:
#

##
# The include directive includes a configuration file or multiple configuration
# files if a wildcard pattern is specified. This can be useful when maintaining
# configuration on multiple hosts to keep the differences in separate files.
#chrony_conf_includes: [ /etc/chrony.d/*.conf ]

##
# This directive is used to specify the location of the file containing ID-key
# pairs for authentication of NTP packets. The argument is simply the name of
# the file containing the ID-key pairs. The format of the file is shown below:
chrony_conf_keyfile: /etc/chrony.keys

##
# The lock_all directive will lock chronyd into RAM so that it will never be
# paged out. This mode is only supported on Linux. This directive uses the Linux
# mlockall() system call to prevent chronyd from ever being swapped out. This
# should result in lower and more consistent latency. It should not have
# significant impact on performance as chronyd’s memory usage is modest. The
# mlockall(2) man page has more details.
#chrony_conf_lock_all: false

##
# chronyd always writes its process ID (PID) to a file, and checks this file on
# startup to see if another chronyd may already be running on the system. By
# default, the file used is /var/run/chronyd.pid. The pidfile directive allows
# the name to be changed, e.g.:
#chrony_conf_pidfile: /var/run/chronyd.pid

##
# On Linux, the sched_priority directive will select the SCHED_FIFO real-time
# scheduler at the specified priority (which must be between 0 and 100). On Mac
# OS X, this option must have either a value of 0 (the default) to disable the
# thread time constraint policy or 1 for the policy to be enabled. Other systems
# do not support this option. On Linux, this directive uses the
# sched_setscheduler() system call to instruct the kernel to use the SCHED_FIFO
# first-in, first-out real-time scheduling policy for chronyd with the specified
# priority. This means that whenever chronyd is ready to run it will run,
# interrupting whatever else is running unless it is a higher priority real-time
# process. This should not impact performance as chronyd resource requirements
# are modest, but it should result in lower and more consistent latency since
# chronyd will not need to wait for the scheduler to get around to running it.
# You should not use this unless you really need it. The sched_setscheduler(2)
# man page has more details. On Mac OS X, this directive uses the
# thread_policy_set() kernel call to specify real-time scheduling. As noted for
# Linux, you should not use this directive unless you really need it.
#chrony_conf_sched_priority: 0

##
# The user directive sets the name of the system user to which chronyd will
# switch after start in order to drop root privileges. On Linux, chronyd needs
# to be compiled with support for the libcap library. On Mac OS X, FreeBSD,
# NetBSD and Solaris chronyd forks into two processes. The child process retains
# root privileges, but can only perform a very limited range of privileged
# system calls on behalf of the parent. The compiled-in default value is root.
#chrony_conf_user: root
